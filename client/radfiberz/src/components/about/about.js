            <p>Hello, my name is Amanda, and I am the proud owner of RadFiberz! Since 2017,
                I have been creating unique and beautiful art pieces that have been showcased
                in various booths, shows, and businesses. My passion for crafting has led me to
                use only the finest materials, including polymer clay, metals, fibers, and dyes,
                to create one-of-a-kind, handcrafted items. If you have any questions or inquiries,
                please do not hesitate to reach out to me through the contact options listed. Thank
                you for supporting small businesses and for taking the time to check us out!</p>
